    <h1>More About My Comic: Felix</h1>

    <p>
        On this page, I want to share more about my comic project, Felix. 
        The story focuses on emotional healing, friendship, and growth. 
        Through Felix and Milo, I hope to explore themes of recovery and learning how to build a new life after hardship.
